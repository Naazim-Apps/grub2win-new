# Grub2Win 3.0
A revised Grub2Win, with updated icons and newer graphics.

The current Grub2Win 2.3.8.4 is still actively developed on, but it has older, outdated and inaccurate icons and graphics. I wanted to update it. It's still the same interface (mostly), but it has newer icons and backgrounds. 

For best results, set G2W 3.0 to 1920x1080.
If you find any bugs, let me know! Remember that most bugs that existed in the original G2W are still here, although I am trying to patch them.
I am still working on the EXE, that is coming soon!

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the Releases tab
2. Extract to a folder titled "grub2" in your C:\ (or equivalent) directory
3. Create a shortcut from the grub2win.exe file, and place it on your Desktop or in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs to add it to the Start menu
4. Open it up!
